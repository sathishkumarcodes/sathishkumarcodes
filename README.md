## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer turned Product person**, focused on building and shipping AI-powered products end-to-end — from idea, to architecture, to working software in users’ hands.

- 🧠 Blend of **engineering depth**, **product strategy**, and **founder energy**
- 🚀 Currently building **3 core products**: OneGoodThingApp, Moona, RepoExplainer
- 🤖 Experimenting with **AI agents** for code, portfolios, and personal reflection
- ⚙️ I love turning messy, ambiguous problems into clear, shippable products
