## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer turned Product person**, focused on building and shipping AI-powered products end-to-end — from idea, to architecture, to working software in users’ hands.

- 🧠 Blend of **engineering depth**, **product strategy**, and **founder energy**
- 🚀 Currently building **3 core products**: OneGoodThingApp, Moona, RepoExplainer
- 🤖 Experimenting with **AI agents** for code, portfolios, and personal reflection
- ⚙️ I love turning messy, ambiguous problems into clear, shippable products

## 🚀 What I’m Building

### 🌟 OneGoodThingApp — Micro-journaling that actually sticks
> **Gratitude journaling in under 10 seconds**

[![OneGoodThingApp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visit-OneGoodThingApp.com-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://onegoodthingapp.com/)

- Capture **one good thing** about your day in seconds  
- Builds a timeline of moments you’d otherwise forget  
- AI surfaces patterns in mood, behavior, and gratitude  
- Built in **48 hours** using Lovable + Supabase, now evolving into a habit system

---

### 📈 Moona — Personal portfolio intelligence
> **Understand your money like a pro**

- Unified view across **stocks, crypto, retirement, and cash**
- Benchmark performance (S&P 500, QQQ, custom indices)
- Explore scenarios with **projections & simulations**
- AI-generated insights like: _“Your risk exposure increased vs last month…”_
- Built with **React, Supabase, FastAPI, Python**

---

### 🧠 RepoExplainer — AI that instantly “gets” your repo
> **Your Staff-level architect for any codebase**

- Upload a GitHub repo or ZIP → get a full **architecture summary**
- File-by-file explanations and module overviews
- Diagrams (system, ERD, flows) auto-generated from structure
- API references and onboarding docs for new engineers
- Powered by **Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI, Tree-sitter, embeddings**
