## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Founder-minded Product Builder with a software engineering background. I take AI-powered products from zero → one: defining the problem, architecting the system, building fast, and shipping to real users.

In my day job, I modernize enterprise healthcare platforms — claims audits, pricing engines, provider data, Medicare/Medicaid logic — partnering with engineering, clinical, and ops to deliver scalable products that actually move the business.

Outside of work, I build independently with velocity and conviction: small teams, fast loops, shipping over polishing, and product intuition leading the way.
