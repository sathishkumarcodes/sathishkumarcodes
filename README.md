## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer turned Product Builder**, focused on taking AI-powered products from **idea → architecture → prototype → users**.

At work, I build **enterprise healthcare tech** — modernizing systems for medical claims, audit workflows, pricing engines, provider data, and government program rules. I partner with engineering, clinical, and operations teams to deliver:

- High-accuracy claims audits  
- Scalable claims & pricing platforms  
- Better pricing logic for Medicare/Medicaid/commercial payers  
- Modern UI/UX for legacy audit systems  

Outside of work, I build fast and independently with founder energy:

- 🚀 **OneGoodThingApp**, **Moona**, **RepoExplainer**  
- 🤖 AI agents for code intelligence, journaling insights & portfolio analytics  
- ⚙️ I turn ambiguous problems into clear, simple, shippable products

## 🚀 What I’m Building

### 🌟 OneGoodThingApp — Micro-journaling that actually sticks
> **Gratitude journaling in under 10 seconds**
